This should work out to 3-4 hours a week. 45 hours is the target because that is a typical requirement for entry into a credential program, so you might as well get that out of the way.</p> <h2 id="Heading2"> Where can you volunteer?</h2> <p> Submit your preferences online (<a class="url http outside" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?key=0AnuJN_BYETiacGRLVU1FVlF3TU9XdmhGeFozMTRQTUE&amp;amp;hl=en_US#gid=0">form here</a>) We will do our best to match you with a teacher and site fitting your preferences, while also providing an interesting experience. Once matched, you and the teacher will negotiate a convenient schedule for the visits. Aim to visit second and third year math courses. We have interested teachers on each side of the Bay. Past schools who have offered us placements include:</p> <ul> <li> Berkeley HS (Berkeley)</li> <li> City Arts and Tech (SF)</li> <li> Dougherty Valley High (San Ramon)</li> <li> El Camino HS (South SF)</li> <li> Envision Academy (Oakland, CA)</li> <li> Hillsdale HS (San Mateo)</li> <li> Mission HS (SF)</li> <li> San Mateo HS (San Mateo)</li> <li> T.R. Pollicita MS (Daly City)</li> <li> Washington HS (SF)</li> </ul> <h2 id="Heading3"> What will you do?</h2> <p> It depends on you and your teacher. First, you&rsquo;ll observe and get a sense of the classroom. When you and your host are ready, you might silently observe for the teacher, work with individual students or groups that needed special attention, help facilitate or observe group work. Some have even (eventually) made presentations or led lessons.</p> <h2 id="Heading4"> What are the bureaucratic requirements?</h2> <ul> <li> Get fingerprinted. (Available on campus for $5) See <a class="url http" href="http://www.sfsu.edu/~upd/html/fingerprinting.html">http://www.sfsu.edu/~upd/html/fingerprinting.html</a></li> <li> Get a TB Test. (Available on campus for $25) See <a href="http://health.sfsu.edu/Student_Health_Services_List_of_Charges.html">http://health.sfsu.edu/Student_Health_Services_List_of_Charges.html</a></li> </ul> <p> You should bring some proof of each of these to show your teacher or the administration. Sometimes you aren&rsquo;t asked for it, but it&rsquo;s good to have it.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> At the end of the semester, you will bring the teacher a couple of pages of paperwork so we can give them a (too) small thank you stipend.&nbsp;</p></p></div><div class="wrapper close"></div></div><div class="footer">
