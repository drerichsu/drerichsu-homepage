# Math 226.11-12, Fall 2019
 
## Math 226 Class Syllabus in Plain English
 
**Class:** Math 226.11 and 226.12, Fall 2019  
**Class Meetings:** TuTh 12:30-1:45 and Wed 12:00-12:50  
**Instructor:** Eric Hsu, erichsu@sfsu.edu  
**Office Hours:** W 10:00-11:00 and by appointment at erichsu.youcanbook.me
 
**General Description:** Calculus is a great advance in human thinking that builds on the mathematical insights across centuries from cultures across the world, including Ancient Egyptian, Greek, Indian, Chinese, Arabic, European, and others. It gives a powerful and precise language to describe dynamic change and calculate important quantities.
 
In this class, I want you to become more powerful in using math. I want you to analyze new situations using math. I want you to convince others using math. I want you to understand other people’s ideas using math. So we will spend class time practicing these powers with each other. I want the math muscles in your brain to get stronger. It’s my job to give you tasks that will give your brain resistance for your mental workouts.
 
**Textbook:** Calculus: Early Transcendentals (3rd edition) by Briggs, Cochran, Gillett, and Shulz. The textbook comes with a slip of paper (DON’T LOSE IT) containing your access code for the online homework site, MyLab. The course code for MyLab is hsu73056. Registration instructions at tinyurl.com/HsuF19MyLab. At ilearn.sfsu.edu, I will post grades and a long version of this syllabus.
 
**Assessment:** Your grade in this course will computed from: Homework (40%), Big Fun Quiz (10%), Midterm (15%), Final on Thu Dec 19, 12:30-2:30 (25%), Quizzes & Class Work (10%). There are no curves, so you can all get an A. Come to every class, support each other, be present. If you fall behind, come see me and we’ll catch up. We’re in this together.
 
**Sex Discrimination and Violence.** I am always available to discuss these important issues. Our campus takes this very seriously, so I’m required to report what you tell me to the Dean of Students. Campus does have a confidential resource, the SAFE Place. http://psyservs.sfsu.edu/content/safe-place.
 
**Accommodations for Religion & Disabilities.** I want to make this class a place where everyone is in their best situation to learn and their best situation to show me what they can do. So talk to me in the first two weeks if we can improve your learning by making reason- able accommodations. The campus disabilities resource is DPRC http://access.sfsu.edu.

Calculus I 
MATH 0226 
11-12
Fall 2019 
 
**Course Information**. Calculus is a great advance in human thinking that builds on the mathematical insights across centuries from cultures across the world, including Ancient Egyptian, Greek, Indian, Chinese, Arabic, European, and others. It gives a powerful and precise language to describe dynamic change and calculate important quantities.

In this class, I want you to become more powerful in using math. I want you to analyze new situations using math. I want you to convince others using math. I want you to understand other people’s ideas using math. So we will spend class time practicing these powers with each other. I want the math muscles in your brain to get stronger. It’s my job to give you tasks that will give your brain resistance for your mental workouts.

## Student Learning Objectives 
### Official Course Objectives 
MATH 226 is the first semester of calculus for science, engineering, and math majors. This is not a business calculus course. Students entering Calculus I should have a firm grasp of algebra and trigonometry. They should be able to graph elementary algebraic and transcendental functions and their inverses. Students should also be able to solve inequalities and equations involving exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions. The main objective of Calculus I is for students to learn the basics of the calculus of functions of one variable. They will study transcendental functions, limits, differentiation and an introduction to the Riemann integral, culminating with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. They will also apply these ideas to a wide range of problems that include the equations of motion, related rates, curve sketching and optimization. The students should be able to interpret the concepts of Calculus algebraically, graphically and verbally. More generally, the students will improve their ability to think critically, to analyze a problem and solve it using a wide array of tools. These skills will be invaluable to them in whatever path they choose to follow, be it as a mathematics major or in pursuit of a career in one of the other sciences. 

### Official Student Learning Outcomes 
**Upon successful completion of the course, students should be able to:** 
* Evaluate a variety of limits, including limits at infinity, one-sided limits, and limits of indeterminate forms. Students should also be able to identify discontinuities in functions presented algebraically or graphically. 
* Apply the definition of derivative to calculate and estimate derivatives from formulas, graphs, or data. 
* Differentiate sums, products and quotients of composite polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. 
* Discuss the conceptual relations among derivatives, rates of change, and tangent lines in the context of an applied example. 
* Use asymptotes, first and second derivatives to graph functions. 
* Solve applied problems using calculus and justify answers. 
* Estimate a definite integral with a Riemann sum.
* Evaluate a simple definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. 

## Policies 

### Religious Holidays 
Reasonable accommodations will be made for you to observe religious holidays when such observances require you to be absent from class activities. It is your responsibility to inform me during the first two weeks of class, in writing, about such holidays. 

### Important Dates & Deadlines 
* Adding Classes with Permission Numbers : Monday, August 26 – Monday, September 16 
* Last Day for Faculty Drops Sunday , September 15

* Withdrawal from Classes  orUniversity  by Exception for Documented Serious and Compelling Reasons: Wednesday, November 20 – Monday, December 16 


### Statement of Commitment to Equity 
**San Francisco State University is committed to promoting equity and social justice within a respectful and safe environment. (See SFSU Strategic Plan http:**//www.sfsu.edu/strategicplan/strategic.html ). Accordingly, the instructor of this course has taken the SFSU Community Pledge, promising to stand against acts of hate and bigotry and to defend targeted members of our community who are undocumented, people of color, LGBTQI, Muslim (or other targeted religious groups), Palestinians, refugees, immigrants, the differently abled, and women. 

### Dishonesty Policy 
Cheating is a serious violation of the academic code of conduct. Stu- dents who have been found cheating will be notified, and their act will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. Any assignment or exam that is the product of cheating will receive no credit. 

### Amendments 
I reserve the right to make changes to the structure of the course if I think it will enhance the learning experience. Any such changes will be announced in class. 

### Extra Credit 
At my discretion, I may give chances to get extra credit.  Don’t tell anyone else about this, let them figure it out on their own.
