This is not a business calculus course. Students entering Calculus I should have a firm grasp of algebra and trigonometry. They should be able to graph elementary algebraic and transcendental functions and their inverses. Students should also be able to solve inequalities and equations involving exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions. The main objective of Calculus I is for students to learn the basics of the calculus of functions of one variable. They will study transcendental functions, limits, differentiation and an introduction to the Riemann integral, culminating with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. They will also apply these ideas to a wide range of problems that include the equations of motion, related rates, curve sketching and optimization. The students should be able to interpret the concepts of Calculus algebraically, graphically and verbally. More generally, the students will improve their ability to think critically, to analyze a problem and solve it using a wide array of tools. These skills will be invaluable to them in whatever path they choose to follow, be it as a mathematics major or in pursuit of a career in one of the other sciences.&nbsp;</p><p>Official Student Learning Outcomes&nbsp;</p><p>Upon successful completion of the course, students should be able to:&nbsp;</p><p>Evaluate a variety of limits, including limits at infinity, one-sided limits, and limits of indeterminate forms. Students should also be able to identify discontinuities in functions presented algebraically or graphically.&nbsp;<br />Apply the definition of derivative to calculate and estimate derivatives from formulas, graphs, or data.&nbsp;<br />Differentiate sums, products and quotients of composite polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions.&nbsp;<br />Discuss the conceptual relations among derivatives, rates of change, and tangent lines in the context of an applied example.&nbsp;<br />Use asymptotes, first and second derivatives to graph functions.&nbsp;<br />Solve applied problems using calculus and justify answers.&nbsp;<br />Estimate a definite integral with a Riemann sum.<br />Evaluate a simple definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.&nbsp;</p><p>Policies&nbsp;<br />Religious Holidays&nbsp;</p><p>Reasonable accommodations will be made for you to observe religious holidays when such observances require you to be absent from class activities. It is your responsibility to inform me during the first two weeks of class, in writing, about such holidays.&nbsp;</p><p>Important Dates &amp; Deadlines&nbsp;</p><p>Adding Classes with Permission Numbers&nbsp;: Monday, August 26 &ndash; Monday, September 16&nbsp;</p><p>:&nbsp;Last Day for Faculty Drops&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;,&nbsp;September 15&nbsp;</p><p>:&nbsp;Last Day to Drop/Withdraw Classes without a W grade&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;,&nbsp;September 16&nbsp;</p><p>Withdrawal from&nbsp;Classes&nbsp;&nbsp;orUniversity&nbsp;&nbsp;for Serious and Compelling Reasons:Tuesday&nbsp;,&nbsp;September 17&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Tuesday&nbsp;,&nbsp;November 19&nbsp;</p><p>:&nbsp;Credit/No Credit Option Deadline&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;,&nbsp;October 21&nbsp;</p><p>Withdrawal from&nbsp;Classes&nbsp;&nbsp;orUniversity&nbsp;&nbsp;by Exception for Documented Serious and Compelling Reasons:Wednesday, November 20 &ndash; Monday, December 16&nbsp;</p><p>Statement of Commitment to Equity&nbsp;</p><p>San Francisco State University is committed to promoting equity and social justice within a respectful and safe environment. (See SFSU Strategic Plan&nbsp;http://www.sfsu.edu/strategicplan/strategic.html&nbsp;). Accordingly, the instructor of this course has taken the SFSU Community Pledge, promising to stand against acts of hate and bigotry and to defend targeted members of our community who are undocumented, people of color, LGBTQI, Muslim (or other targeted religious groups), Palestinians, refugees, immigrants, the differently abled, and women.&nbsp;</p><p>Dishonesty Policy&nbsp;</p><p>Cheating is a serious violation of the academic code of conduct. Stu- dents who have been found cheating will be notified, and their act will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. Any assignment or exam that is the product of cheating will receive no credit.&nbsp;</p><p>Amendments&nbsp;</p><p>I reserve the right to make changes to the structure of the course if I think it will enhance the learning experience. Any such changes will be announced in class.&nbsp;</p><p>Extra Credit&nbsp;</p><p>At my discretion, I may give chances to get extra credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t tell anyone else about this, let them figure it out on their own.&nbsp;</p><p>Resources&nbsp;<br />Supplemental Instruction &mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;SI</p><p>http://csme.sfsu.edu/SI</p><p>What; is a SCI course?
