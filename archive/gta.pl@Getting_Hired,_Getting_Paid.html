Typically the checks are available on the last day of the month after 4pm, although it is best to check the calendar you receive in the packet. Direct deposit is not available.</p><p>If you want a friend to pick up a check, send a signed note with the person stating their name. They will sign for the check and we will retain the note. If it’s someone we don’t know, we’ll ask for ID. </p></div><div class="wrapper close"></div></div><div class="footer">
