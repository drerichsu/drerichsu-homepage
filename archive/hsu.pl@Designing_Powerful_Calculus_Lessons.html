<h1>Hierarchy of Student Needs (sorry Maslow)</h1><ul><li><strong>1. Base need</strong><ul><li>Shelter, health, food.</li><li><strong>To get a good grade</strong></li><li>To have a fair shot to get a good grade</li></ul></li><li><strong>2. Safety</strong><ul><li>To be respected in class</li><li>To ask questions honestly</li><li>To have personal boundaries</li><li>To be comfortable*<ul><li>adjustment period to being pushed to be active</li></ul></li><li>Teacher to be in charge</li></ul></li><li><strong>3. Love and belonging</strong><ul><li>To be liked by the teacher<ul><li>At least for the teacher to want them to succeed</li></ul></li><li>To be liked by peers</li><li>To feel belonging to the college</li></ul></li><li><strong>4. Esteem needs</strong><ul><li><p>To understand</p></li><li><p>To get the right answer</p></li><li><p>To show off their talents</p></li><li>Students can show off: quickness, humor, creativity, worldly experience, academic language, drawing/visual skills, independence.<ul><li>want to build on their power and harness it for math power</li><li>Full brain, not guessing at the answer we want to hear</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>5. Personal growth</strong></li></ul><h2>Quality&nbsp;Group Tasks</h2><ul><li><em><strong>(look at Worksheets 2, 3, 4). Take general comments.&nbsp;</strong></em></li><li>Non-routineness.&nbsp;​It&#39;s okay to start off with a warm-up/check-up routine task, but if all questions are routine, the fast students will be bored/over-confident and the slow students will feel depressed.</li><li>Don&#39;t over-structure.&nbsp;Flag Hoist could have been a step-by-step worksheet: &quot;now estimate the slope at three points&quot;, &quot;describe what the hoister is doing at t=0, 2 and 4. You can always ADD hints and structure. Figuring out what to do is part of the adventure and creativity.</li><li>Almost anything that requires interpretation, or deciding something due to a calculation.<ul><li>Anything they could argue about using math. &quot;What the most realistic?&quot;</li></ul></li><li>Converting between representations.&nbsp;</li><li><ul><li>Graphs and tables are good because whole groups can look at them together.</li><li>Graphs, tables, verbal, symbolic, kinesthetic</li></ul></li><li>Routine tasks, prematurely!<ul><li>You can take something you were going to lecture on, and let them try it first. Then if no one gets it, do a mini-lecture. Even if they get it, it&rsquo;s good to sum it up.</li><li>I ask them to write a derivative definition from idea of limit of average rates of change. Then you can mini-lecture about it because they&rsquo;ve been thinking about it.</li><li>They can try a task from a later chapter.</li><li>Or it can be a routine task without the scaffolding or context (so they don&#39;t know which approach to take).</li><li>Almost any&nbsp;word problem they don&#39;t have a rote recipe for solving.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Differentiation</strong> (pedagogy, not calculus): content, process and product<ul><li>Interesting partial results.​&nbsp;<ul><li>Sub-cases solved. Solved with simplifying assumptions. Intriguing approaches that dead-ended for interesting reasons.&nbsp;</li><li>You want people lifting their appropriate weight.</li></ul></li><li>Admit multiple solution paths.<ul><li><p>Then in de-brief have multiple approaches presented. Ideally, make connections between them.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Also, good for non-boring aerobics. Compare different methods.&nbsp;E.g. 6.4. Compute this derivative using product &amp; quotient, and then do this using only constant, sum, diff and power. &amp; 8.5. (&nbsp;(x^3)^5 )&#39;&nbsp;using chain rule, using power rule. Practice for algebra, exponents, exercises derivative rules, has a built-in check.​</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>A lot more thoughts on picking and using rich tasks at Hsu, E., Kysh, J., and Resek, D.

About four weeks.<ul><li>About 25% are really into it right away.</li><li>About 50% go along with it, seeing if you&#39;ll stick with it.&nbsp;</li><li>About 25% are suspicious and may take a little longer. They want to see if they can get a good grade in this format. So have an early Big Fun Quiz.&nbsp;Give them praise, build on their connections to classmates...</li></ul></li><li>You. A semester or a lifetime.<ul><li>How do you know how hard&nbsp;a problem is, or how rich it is?</li><li>You learn through time and honest observation. I always write a short sentence after the class in my day plan noting how hard the task was and improvements for next time.</li><li>Don&#39;t change everything at once. I often have to back off of something too-ambitious after week 3.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Further Resources</h2><ul><li><a href="hsu.pl@Calculus_I_With_Group_Work,_Fall_2008.html" class="local">Calculus I With Group Work, Fall 2008</a> (Materials, worksheets, teaching outline)</li><li><a href="prob.pl.html">The Better File Cabinet</a>, a database of Treisman workshop calculus and precalculus problems.</li><li>Hauk,S., Speer, N.
