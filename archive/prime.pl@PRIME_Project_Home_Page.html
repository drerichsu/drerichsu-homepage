Additional network after-school centralized workshops, monthly site collaborations, and in-classroom coaching support will provide 24 hours of follow up annually for a total of 72 hours after three years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Partner-led professional development will focus on developing teachers&rsquo; content knowledge and teaching skills that lead to student mastery of both mathematic concepts and procedures. Topics of study will address number systems, rational numbers, and algebraic thinking. A key feature of the grant is to directly address the achievement gap. Schools eligible for participation either had an achievement gap for African Americans, Hispanic-Latinos, and English Learners within their school or had overall lower than district average results on state standardized tests in mathematics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pedagogical professional development will emphasize multiple modalities of learning, using assessment data to analyze student understanding and misconceptions about mathematics, and designing engaging lessons using the state adopted instructional materials. The three year program is designed to develop teacher leaders who can lead professional development at the site and district wide.</p><h2>Cohorts and Funding</h2><p>PRIME has been funded by two generous grants from the CA Department of Education.</p><ul><li>(2011-2014) <a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/pd/ca/ma/camspintrod.asp">California Math Science Partnership, Cohort 8</a>.
