# MATH 375: Early Field Experience for Future Teachers
## Instructors
* Tracy Thompson, Washington High School, tracythompson@earthlink.net
* Eric Hsu, SFSU, TH 932, erichsu@sfsu.edu  (placement support)
## Class Meetings and Web Page
W 1610-1855, Trailer H-2. Office hours after class and by appointment.

## Prerequisites
Math 301 or consent of instructor and interest in teaching mathematics in K-12 schools as a career. Math majors interested in teaching are recommended to take this course in their sophomore or junior year.
## Bulletin Description
This 3-unit course provides the opportunity for students to relate the mathematics they are learning to the teaching and learning of mathematics at the middle and high school levels and at the same time fulfill the 45-hour field experience requirement for prospective teachers.
## Course Objectives
Students will:
* Serve as an assistant and observer in a K-12 math class,
* Learn teaching, facilitating, and helping skills,
* Expand their understanding of how students learn and respond to schooling,
* Become familiar with some research on student learning,
* Gain understanding of the mathematics knowledge needed for teaching,
* See what life as a high school teacher is like, and
* Get 45 hrs of classrooms experience, fulfilling a requirement of state credential programs.
## Evaluation of Students
Students will demonstrate their mastery of the first five objectives on weekly homework assignments as well as active participation in class discussions and group presentations. Students will also carry out their fieldwork reliably, positively and constructively.
 
* Fieldwork                    30%                            
* Homework:                 30%
* Class Participation       40%
 
## Homework  
Most weeks, homework will consist of a 1-2 page written reflection to a reading assignment or class discussion. Assignments may be turned in via email, and are due the day of the next class. Points will be deducted 20% for late work (up to one week late only). 

## Course Outline
The order in which we work on the following topics may vary.
* Instrumental and Conceptual Knowledge
* Problem solving and its central role in teaching and learning mathematics
* Inquiry based learning and construction of understanding
* Teaching methods that support students’ building understanding
* Electronic learning tools
* Structuring mathematics lessons for secondary students
* Connections between topics at the 7-12 level and sorting out the big mathematical ideas
* Cultural assumptions or preferences and community building in the classroom
* Assessing what students understand
* High stakes testing and its effects on students, teachers, curriculum
* The realities of teaching as a career

## Textbooks and Software
None. Most readings will be available online. Access to a graphing calculator helpful but not necessary.

## Visits
These are discussed in more detail at 375 Visit Info below.

## Bureaucratic requirements
To volunteer in a K-12 school, the following are needed:
* Get fingerprinted. (Available on campus for $5)      http://www.sfsu.edu/~upd/html/fingerprinting.html
* Get a TB Test. (Available on campus for $25)        http://health.sfsu.edu/Student_Health_Services_List_of_Charges.html

## Disabilities
Students with disabilities who need reasonable accommodations are encouraged to contact the instructor.  The Disability Programs and Resource Center (DPRC) is available to facilitate the reasonable accommodations process.  The DPRC is located in the Student Service Building and can be reached by telephone (voice/TTY 415-338-2472) or by email (dprc@sfsu.edu). (http://www.sfsu.edu/~dprc/facultyfaq.html#1)

## 375 Early Field Experience Volunteering
You will be spending at least 45 hours this semester in a secondary school. This should work out to 3-4 hours a week. 45 hours is the target because that is a typical requirement for entry into a credential program, so you might as well get that out of the way.
## Where can you volunteer?
Submit your preferences online (form here) We will do our best to match you with a teacher and site fitting your preferences, while also providing an interesting experience. Once matched, you and the teacher will negotiate a convenient schedule for the visits. Aim to visit second and third year math courses. We have interested teachers on each side of the Bay. Past schools who have offered us placements include:
* Berkeley HS (Berkeley)
* City Arts and Tech (SF)
* Dougherty Valley High (San Ramon)
* El Camino HS (South SF)
* Envision Academy (Oakland, CA)
* Hillsdale HS (San Mateo)
* Mission HS (SF)
* San Mateo HS (San Mateo)
* T.R. Pollicita MS (Daly City)
* Washington HS (SF)
## What will you do?
It depends on you and your teacher. First, you’ll observe and get a sense of the classroom. When you and your host are ready, you might silently observe for the teacher, work with individual students or groups that needed special attention, help facilitate or observe group work. Some have even (eventually) made presentations or led lessons.
## What are the bureaucratic requirements?
* Get fingerprinted. (Available on campus for $5) See http://www.sfsu.edu/~upd/html/fingerprinting.html
* Get a TB Test. (Available on campus for $25) See http://health.sfsu.edu/Student_Health_Services_List_of_Charges.html
You should bring some proof of each of these to show your teacher or the administration. Sometimes you aren’t asked for it, but it’s good to have it.
 
At the end of the semester, you will bring the teacher a couple of pages of paperwork so we can give them a (too) small thank you stipend.
