# Coursework Evaluation
Thank you for your interest in having SFSU evaluate your mathematics coursework. 
 
If you want to have your existing undergraduate coursework evaluated for fulfilling math competency equivalent to a single-subject waiver program, please follow these steps:

1. If you are (a) a current SFSU student or (b) applying for the SFSU credential program, there is no fee. Otherwise, there is an evaluation fee of $100 that should be paid by sending a check payable to SFSU, to
 
    * Transcript Evaluation  
Mathematics Department  
1600 Holloway Ave  
San Francisco, CA  94132  
 
    * Write "transcript evaluation" in the check comment field.
 
2. E-mail the following documents to statmath@sfsu.edu:
    * Download the form Coursework List, and fill out a proposed course by course equivalence between your coursework and the 45-unit SFSU waiver program.  For course details visit https://math.sfsu.edu/courses. We are allowed to use some judgment, so please list separately at the end any other math courses you've passed that have no precise SFSU equivalent.  
    * Provide an electronic copy of a unofficial transcript with final grades for the courses you list.
    * Provide official course descriptions for any non-SFSU courses you list.  A web link to an official university course description site is sufficient, if it tells us what was actually covered in the courses taken.  
3. If everything is in order, I will email you a signed form. This may be enough documentation for your purposes. If you want an official letter, you will need to contact our credential office and they may charge a small fee for a certificate ($25 as of 2020).
 
We hope to finish evaluations in a timely way, but it may take up to a month or longer from receipt of your materials and evaluation fee.  You can email erichsu@sfsu.edu with further questions.
