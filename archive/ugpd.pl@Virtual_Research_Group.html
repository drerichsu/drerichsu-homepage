Not everyone has such a group at their local institution and others would like the opportunity to discuss issues focused more narrowly on TAs and college teaching.</p><p>This space was created as a virtual meeting place for folks interested in discussing TA-related research issues. While the listserv is an excellent tool for quick questions or feedback, this is intended to be a space for more sustained work or more extensive interactions.</p><p>Are you working on a paper that you would like some feedback on? Are you preparing a paper or talk for a conference and wanting help of some sort? Need help revising a set of interview questions? If so, add to this page and send out a note to the TA research listserv, letting folks know that there is something for discussion in the Virtual Research Group space.</p><p><ul><li>Available for review and/or comment:*</li></ul></p><p><a class="url http outside" href="http://hopper.unco.edu/faculty/personal/hauk/med710/GTAdiary_JGTAPD_submit.htm">Diary of a Graduate Teaching Assistant (HTML file).
