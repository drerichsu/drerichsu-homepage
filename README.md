# Erdos-Bacon Number

Every now and then someone asks what my Erdos number is, and more rarely, what my Bacon number is. You can decide for
    yourself if my numbers are well-defined, as I use math education papers to calculate Erdos number and TV to
    calculate Bacon number. (Calculations done May 2010.)
    
* **My [Erdos Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd≈ës_number) is 4.** I coauthored with Diane
    Resek. /&nbsp;Diane Resek&nbsp;coauthored with&nbsp;L&eacute;on Henkin&nbsp;MR0366659 (51 #2906) / &nbsp;L&eacute;on
    Henkin&nbsp;coauthored with&nbsp;Alfred Tarski MR0124250 (23 #A1564) / Alfred Tarski&nbsp;coauthored with&nbsp;Paul
    Erd&ouml;s1&nbsp;MR0008249 (4,269b).

* **My [Bacon Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers) is 3**:
    When I was in the 7th grade,&nbsp;I was a regular member of a large kid panel on a TV show called <i>[Livewire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livewire_(talk_show))</i>
    hosted by Fred Newman.&nbsp;Fred Newman (I) was in <i>Harry and the Hendersons</i>  with John Lithgow.&nbsp; John Lithgow
    was in <i>Footloose</i> with Kevin Bacon.
    
* Thus my **Erdos-Bacon Number is 7**.

* *Bonus*: **My [Black Sabbath Number](http://static.echonest.com/SixDegreesOfBlackSabbath/index.html") is
            17**:
Black Sabbath had member Neil Murray / Neil Murray was a member of Colosseum II / Colosseum II
        had member Gary Moore / Gary Moore was a member of BBM / BBM had member Ginger Baker / Ginger Baker was a member
        of Masters of Reality / Masters of Reality had member Victor Indrizzo / Victor Indrizzo was a member of Samiam /
        Samiam had member Tr&eacute; Cool / Tr&eacute; Cool was a member of Green Day / Green Day had member Billie Joe
        Armstrong / Billie Joe Armstrong was a member of Pinhead Gunpowder / Pinhead Gunpowder had member Aaron Cometbus
        / Aaron Cometbus was a member of Harbinger / Harbinger had member Robert Eggplant / Robert Eggplant was a member
        of the Hope Bombs / The Hope Bombs had member Eric Hsu.</p>

* Therefore **my Erdos-Bacon-Sabbath number is 24**.
