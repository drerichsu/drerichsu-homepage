First of all, the <a class="url http outside" href="gta.pl/GTA_Teaching_Resources.html#toc2">Teaching Binder</a> contains many lessons people have tried. Furthermore, in TH 916 (the copy room), there are binders for each of Math 60 and 70 with activities and lessons that past GTAs have tried. Leaf through these and get inspired!</p><p><h2 id="Heading5">What are MSLOs?</h2> The department is requiring all its faculty (including GTAs) to assess students in a more rich way using a system we have developed in-house as part of the final assessment of each student.</p><p>This system is based on a course-wide list of “measurable student learning outcomes” (MSLOs). I have appended the current version of the MSLOs for 59/60 and 70 to this email. These MSLOs represent the core of what the course is about. Not every teacher will cover every aspect with equal depth, and most of you will cover some aspects that are not listed in the MSLOs.</p><p>The purpose of these MSLOs is to help the department standardize the content of our courses, to help us see how students gain concepts and skills from class to class, and to see how well our curriculum is preparing our students. It is not meant to do evaluation of any individual teacher.</p><p>For each MSLO, please have at least one question on your final exam that addresses part of the MSLO. Then for each student, record the score(s) of the exam question(s) separately and normalize the score to a 10-point scale. This is the minimum you should do to be able to rate your students on each MSLO.</p><p>If you have the energy to rate your students more accurately with further information, such as your knowledge of their other work during the semester, that would be a very welcome contribution. If you did not cover an MSLO in any way during the course, then choose N/A.</p><p>Enter these MSLO ratings using the online system. (The URL will be sent at the end of the semester.) We know there will be questions and uncertainties. Please make a good faith effort to produce helpful data.</p><p>The MSLOs for Spring 2008 were as follows.</p><p><h3 id="Heading6">Math 59/60 (Algebra I)</h3> Students…</p><p><ul><li>represent problem situations with a mathematical model, find meaningful solutions and explain their reasoning;</li><li>represent linear functions using graphical, tabular, symbolic and verbal representations;</li><li>model situations with linear equations and inequalities and solve problems by finding meaningful roots;</li><li>represent polynomials using graphical, tabular, symbolic and verbal representations;</li><li>model situations with quadratic equations and solve problems by finding meaningful roots;</li><li>solve problems involving the addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation of polynomials;</li><li>solve problems using systems of two linear equations;</li></ul> <h3 id="Heading7">Math 70 (Algebra II)</h3> Students…</p><p><ul><li>represent problem situations with a mathematical model, find meaningful solutions and explain their reasoning;</li><li>solve problems using systems of two linear equations or inequalities;</li><li>represent polynomials using graphical, tabular, symbolic and verbal representations;</li><li>represent exponential functions using graphical, tabular, symbolic and verbal representations;</li><li>represent logarithmic functions using graphical, tabular, symbolic and verbal representations;</li><li>model and solve problems with exponential functions with different bases, including 10 and e;</li><li>model and solve problems with logarithmic functions with different bases, including 10 and e;</li><li>model situations with quadratic equations and solve problems by finding meaningful roots using the quadratic formula and other methods;</li></ul></p></div><div class="wrapper close"></div></div><div class="footer">
