# Erdos-Bacon Number
* Every now and then someone asks what my Erdos number is, and more rarely, what my Bacon number is. You can decide for yourself if my numbers are well-defined, as I use math education papers to calculate Erdos number and TV to calculate Bacon number. (Calculations done May 2010.)
 
* My Erdos Number is 4: I coauthored with Diane Resek. / Diane Resek coauthored with Léon Henkin MR0366659 (51 #2906) /  Léon Henkin coauthored with Alfred Tarski MR0124250 (23 #A1564) / Alfred Tarski coauthored with Paul Erdös1 MR0008249 (4,269b). 
 
* My Bacon Number is 3: When I was in the 7th grade, I was a regular member of a large kid panel on a TV show called Livewire hosted by Fred Newman. Fred Newman (I) was in Men in Black (1997) with Steve Rankin. Steve Rankin was in Trapped (2002) with Kevin Bacon.
 
* Thus my Erdos-Bacon Number is 7.
 
* _Bonus_: My Black Sabbath Number is 17: Black Sabbath had member Neil Murray / Neil Murray was a member of Colosseum II / Colosseum II had member Gary Moore / Gary Moore was a member of BBM / BBM had member Ginger Baker / Ginger Baker was a member of Masters of Reality / Masters of Reality had member Victor Indrizzo / Victor Indrizzo was a member of Samiam / Samiam had member Tré Cool / Tré Cool was a member of Green Day / Green Day had member Billie Joe Armstrong / Billie Joe Armstrong was a member of Pinhead Gunpowder / Pinhead Gunpowder had member Aaron Cometbus / Aaron Cometbus was a member of Harbinger / Harbinger had member Robert Eggplant / Robert Eggplant was a member of the Hope Bombs / The Hope Bombs had member Eric Hsu.
 
* So my Erdos-Bacon-Sabbath number is 24.
