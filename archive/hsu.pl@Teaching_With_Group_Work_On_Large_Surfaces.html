Blackboards, and when wall space is available, I use static paper which turns walls into whiteboard space. Lacking wall space, you can use easels or small whiteboards.</li></ul><h2>Opening Class: Norms and Techniques</h2><ul><li><strong>The Worksheets. </strong><a href="http://betterfilecabinet.com/f08/226ws.pdf">http://betterfilecabinet.com/f08/226ws.pdf</a>. The videos use Worksheet 1. Sometimes I introduce the problem before giving out the worksheet.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2Ex4rWhSc4"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2Ex4rWhSc4</a></li><li><strong>Groups</strong>.<ul><li>I go back and forth between openly random groups (no more than 4) and letting them pick. I don&#39;t do any &quot;ability&quot; based algorithms, on purpose. Students are fast and slow, but speed depends on the task.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbdw7rWNSu8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbdw7rWNSu8</a><ul><li>Randomizing algorithms: count off modularly to N, count off and divide by N and find your remainder, hand out cards when they arrive, find at least one person you haven&#39;t worked with.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Managing the Group Work</strong><ul><li>Circulate quickly. Don&#39;t stay with a group for more than a minute.</li><li>Scan large surface work in the room to see people&#39;s progress. Go prod groups that are either &quot;done&quot; or stuck/far behind.</li><li>Have in your pocket some scaffolding questions and also extensions.</li><li>If they think they&#39;re done with task, ask &quot;Is this everyone&#39;s answer? So everyone can explain this?&quot;<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApLed2m4-eo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApLed2m4-eo</a><ul><li>Ask a random person (not always the most certain or uncertain looking one) to start the explanation (sometimes I spin the Pen Of Fate and ask whomever it points to)</li><li>Then ask another person to continue.</li><li>If time, ask them a follow-up to check their understanding.</li><li>If anyone seems disconnected from group answer, be sure to ask them to continue or confirm the answer. If they are openly confused/disagreeing, tell the group you&#39;ll come back in two minutes and they should convince everybody. Then loop back.</li><li>If they are really done, tell them to pat themselves on the back, then give them another task. Either continue to the next class-wide task, or give the a bonus problem/extension.</li></ul></li><li>If stuck, DON&#39;T GIVE THEM A HINT YET. Ask them what they&#39;ve tried.<ul><li>If they abandoned a good strategy, tell them that was a good idea and they should go back to that.</li><li>Praise any interesting strategies, fruitful or not.</li><li>If they&#39;re stuck, try to ask them a key simpler question rather than suggesting a strategy. &quot;Is this a graph of <em>constant</em> hoisting?&quot;</li><li>Leave the group with a productive next question as soon as possible.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Whole Class Discussions</strong><ul><li>Don&#39;t just reward the bold, quick and loud. You can ask a question and then wait for four hands before letting people talk.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNfJNxag6a4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNfJNxag6a4</a></li><li>I&#39;m not organized enough to use clickers, but I use a thumb poll for easy interactivity. Up, down and in-between.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT5LgbNr0CE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT5LgbNr0CE</a></li><li>When someone gives a &quot;crazy&quot; creative answer, you need to give it status. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=761cw1yitaA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=761cw1yitaA</a><ul><li>Enjoy it publicly and also make people follow up mathematically. Spend class attention on it. In fact, on the first day, you should incite/invite crazy creative answers. People need to know they can use their whole creative minds and that they can do math with their own personality.</li></ul></li><li>Choose some key checkpoints that you really want every group to get to. For me, that&#39;s usually one or two key steps/ideas per task.<ul><li>If a lot of people are stuck, you can have them stop and look around the room to get ideas.</li><li>Or have people share a partial result, like &quot;what did people get for the derivative at x=0?&quot;, particularly if people disagree. Then just send them back to groups without resolving the disagreement. &quot;Who&#39;s right?&quot;</li></ul></li><li>There might be 2-3 checkpoints per class session that I want to discuss as a whole class. For those, push along the slower groups until they get at least a partial result. Then give a mini-lecture.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Decent Group Work Task Qualities</strong><ul><li>Non-routineness. <strong>​</strong>It&#39;s okay to start off with a warm-up/check-up routine task, but if all questions are routine, the fast students will be bored/over-confident and the slow students will feel depressed.</li><li>Almost anything that requires interpretation, or deciding something due to a calculation.</li><li>Anything they could argue about using math. &quot;What the most realistic?&quot;</li><li>Multiple solution paths. Good for non-boring aerobics.<ul><li>E.g. 6.4. Compute this derivative using product &amp; quotient, and then do this using only constant, sum, diff and power. &amp; 8.5. (x^3)^5 &lsquo; using chain rule, using power rule. Practice for algebra, exponents, exercises derivative rules, has a built-in check.​</li></ul></li><li>Interesting partial results.</li><li>Almost any word problem.</li><li>Problems solved with graphs. Tables ok.</li><li>Routine tasks, prematurely!<ul><li>You can take something you were going to lecture on, and let them try it first. Then if no one gets it, do a mini-lecture. Even if they get it, it&rsquo;s good to sum it up.</li><li>I ask them to write a derivative definition from idea of limit of average rates of change. Then you can mini-lecture about it because they&rsquo;ve been thinking about it.</li><li>They can try a task from a later chapter.</li><li>Or it can be a routine task without the scaffolding or context (so they don&#39;t know which approach to take).</li></ul></li><li>A lot more thoughts on picking and using rich tasks at Hsu, E., Kysh, J., and Resek, D.
