<h3>Web Site, Textbook and Attendance</h3>
 There are three main teaching threads.

<ul><li>You will get an <em><em style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: normal;">organized presentation</em></em> of material via lectures streamed over the internet as well as through reading a textbook (<i>University Calculus ELEMENTS with Early Transcendentals</i> by Hass, Weir, and Thomas). You should buy the textbook package at the school store, as it includes a bundle of solutions and access to the textbook web site.<ul><li>You will need RealPlayer (<a class="url http" href="http://www.real.com/freeplayer/?rppr=rnwk">http://www.real.com/freeplayer/?rppr=rnwk</a>). This should be free; they may try to trick you into paying, so beware.</li></ul></li><li>You will practice the <em><em style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: normal;">mechanics</em></em> of calculus during homework assignments entered on the computer at the textbook web site. The computer will grade your work on the spot and give you a chance to redo/get help on/re-practice items. There will also be a weekly written assignment.<ul><li>Register on a computer you have regular access to. You will need to install a number of software packages.</li></ul></li><li>You will learn to use calculus to <em><em style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: normal;">solve problems and make arguments</em></em> in the live meeting time. We’ll solve problems alone and in small groups. Because of the emphasis on in-class activity, attendance is mandatory. Missing class without prior notice will cause damage to your academic experience, your grade, and may cause you to be dropped from the class roster. You will also have short weekly writing assignments to practice making arguments.</li></ul>
<h3>Homework and the Weekly Routine</h3>
 This may seem confusing, but basically, always log into your <a class="url http" href="http://coursecompass.com">http://coursecompass.com</a> account. You weekly tasks will be spelled out, complete with links, at the class site in the announcements. Try to log in every couple of days just in case there are any last minute announcements.


Assignments are due by <b>Tuesday</b>. For full credit, complete the previous week’s <em><em style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: normal;">online</em></em> HW before Tuesday class time. Turn in any <em><em style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: normal;">written</em></em> HW at the <i>start</i> of Tuesday class. Sometime on Tuesday, check the class web site for this week’s online and written HW. Late homework will be accepted, but only for 50% credit.


You are allowed and encouraged to work on the homework in groups, but you must write up (or type in) the solutions yourself and in your own words or it will be considered cheating. This includes the computer homework problems. It would be fine to try the computer problems separately, then meet to discuss the harder ones, then separately complete the online assignment.

<h3>Earning Points and Grades</h3>
 There are a number of ways to earn points in the course: <b>Big Quiz</b> (50 pts), <b>Midterm</b> (150 pts), <b>Comprehensive Final Exam </b>(250 pts), <b>Class Group Work</b> (100 pts), <b>Homework</b> (300 pts), <b>Quizzes</b> (150 pts), and occasional extra credit goodies.


There is no curve, so the grades of your fellow students cannot affect your grade. You’ll all be better off helping each other. My intention is to give points of 900+ some kind of A, 800+ some kind of B, 700+ some kind of C, 600+ some kind of D.

<h3>Dates and Accommodations</h3><ul><li><b>Key Dates for This Class</b>. See [[Math 226.06 and 226.08 F08 Schedule]] (also linked at coursecompass.com).</li><li><b>Add, Drop, and Withdraw Deadlines</b>. You can find an official list athttp:/www.sfsu.edu/admisrec/reg/regsched.html/</li><li><b>Religious Holidays</b>. I will make reasonable accommodations for you to observe religious holidays when such observances require you to be absent from class activities. It is your responsibility to inform me during the first two weeks of the class each semester, in writing, about such holidays. You can jog your memory by referring to <a class="url http" href="http://www.interfaithcalendar.org/">http://www.interfaithcalendar.org/</a></li><li><b>Disabilities</b>. Students with disabilities who need reasonable accommodations are encouraged to contact me. The Disability Program and Resource Center is available to facilitate the reasonable accommodations process. The DPRC, located in SSB 110, can be reached by telephone at 338-2472 (voice/TTY) or by email at <a class="url mailto outside" href="mailto:dprc@sfsu.edu">dprc@sfsu.edu</a> .</li><li><b>Tutoring</b>. There are two free tutoring services on campus: CARP (<a class="url http" href="http://www.sfsu.edu/~carp1/">http://www.sfsu.edu/~carp1/</a>) and LAC (<a class="url http" href="http://www.sfsu.edu/~lac/">http://www.sfsu.edu/~lac/</a>). Did I mention they are free? You should take advantage of this if you want someone to talk with about the math. The math department also offers free tutoring in the Fourth Floor Tutoring Room in Thornton Hall.</li></ul>
<h3>Official Learning Objectives</h3>
 Successful students will

<ul><li>(<b>Limits</b>) evaluate a variety of limits including limits at infinity, one-sided limits, and limits of indeterminate forms; be able to identify discontinuities in functions presented algebraically or graphically;</li><li>(<b>Definition of derivative</b>) apply the definition of derivative to calculate and estimate derivatives from formulas, graphs, or data;</li><li>(<b>Differentiation skills</b>) differentiate sums, product and quotients of composite polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions;</li><li>(<b>Interpreting derivatives</b>) discuss the conceptual relations between derivatives, rates of change, and tangent lines in the context of an applied example;</li><li>(<b>Graph analysis</b>) use asymptotes, first and second derivatives to graph functions;</li><li>(<b>Problem solving</b>) solve applied problems using calculus and justify answers;</li><li>(<b>Riemann sums</b>) estimate a definite integral with a Riemann sum, supply a sketch;</li><li>(<b>FTC</b>) evaluate a simple definite integral using the FTC;</li></ul>
